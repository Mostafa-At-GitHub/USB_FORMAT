=========================================================================
A. Unattended with Local Account - use unattend_local_account.xml

- Replace Vx64W in Username and Name with your UserName for Local Account
- Password = admin

  This method is completely unattended. After Install of Windows 10 you can switch to MS Account.
  After Install you can switch Settings > Privacy > Diagnostic Feedback to Basic for reduced Telemetry

  After auto Install of all drivers then use Settings >  Update > Windows Update to Search and Install Updates
  This method is working best and used for Install in VHD to be used for booting from USB Portable SSD on various equipment

=========================================================================
B. Unattended with Microsoft Account - use unattend_ms_account.xml

  During Install give MS Account with e-mailadres and password
  You need to answer 4 questions: PIN code for Logon, Synchronization, Phone, OneDrive
  After Install you can switch Settings > Privacy > Diagnostic Feedback to Basic for reduced Telemetry

  After auto Install of all drivers then use Settings >  Update > Windows Update to Search and Install Updates
  This method is Not completely unattended and is Not preferred by me

How does it work ?
In WinNTSetup you select an unattend.xml file e.g. unattend_local_account.xml or unattend_ms_account.xml
WinNTSetup will copy that file as unattend.xml in folder Windows\Panther on the installation drive.
During Install of Windows 10 then file Windows\Panther\unattend.xml  is used to give answers ....
